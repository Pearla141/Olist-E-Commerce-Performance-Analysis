# E-Commerce Performance Dashboard - Olist

![Dashboard Preview](Olist_E-commerce_ERD.png)

## 📊 Project Summary
I developed an interactive Excel dashboard analyzing Brazilian e-commerce performance data from Olist, a leading marketplace connecting small businesses to major channels. The dashboard processes over 96,000 orders totaling £15.49M in revenue, providing comprehensive insights into revenue trends, seller performance, delivery operations, and payment patterns. Using SQL for data extraction and transformation across multiple related tables (customers, products, sellers, payments, deliveries), this end-to-end analytics solution enables stakeholders to monitor key performance indicators and identify operational opportunities. The dashboard features dynamic visualizations for trend analysis, seller concentration metrics, delivery performance by state, and payment installment correlations to support data-driven business decisions in the e-commerce marketplace sector.

## 💡 Key Insights
- **Revenue Growth**: Revenue steadily increased from 2016 to 2018 with peak performance in Q4 2017 to Q1 2018, demonstrating strong business momentum and seasonal patterns
- **Seller Concentration**: Top 20% of sellers contribute 81.62% of total revenue, indicating strong revenue concentration and highlighting the importance of key seller relationships and retention strategies
- **Delivery Performance**: Average delivery time varies significantly by state, with RR (Roraima) having the longest lead time and SP (São Paulo) the shortest, revealing geographic operational challenges and optimization opportunities
- **Payment Behavior**: Higher installment payment plans (up to 24 installments) correlate with higher average order values, suggesting that flexible payment options drive larger purchases and customer spending

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **SQL**: Complex multi-table data extraction, joins, and transformation across customer, product, seller, payment, and delivery datasets
- **Microsoft Excel**: Advanced dashboard design, data visualization, KPI calculation, and interactive reporting
- **Data Analysis**: Revenue trend analysis, seller performance metrics, geographic delivery analysis, and payment pattern correlation
